a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

The numbers should range from 0 to 99
The two numbers should be separated by a space
All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
You can only use the putchar function
